# Exploring Sales Data Using SQL and Tableau

## SQL

We use SQL to inspect and query the sales data contained in vehicle_sales_data.csv.

When querying, we keep such questions in mind:
1. What was the best month for sales and how much was made in that month?
2. What product is sold in that month?
3. Who is our best customer?
4. What products are often sold together?

We conduct an RFM analysis to help answer questions 3 and 4, splitting the data into quartiles, and categorizing certain patterns.

## Tableau

We finally use Tableau to graphically represent insights we have gained from the data, forming two dashboards.
